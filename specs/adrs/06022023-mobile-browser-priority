# Priority of Desktop over Mobile Browsers in Application support

## Context and Problem Statement

Our app may have issues running on mobile without specifically intentioned efforts to improve the experience.


## Decision Drivers

* Making the mobile version run well would require more development time and could stretch our resources for the project.
* A large majority of people use a desktop browser or mobile app, but likely not a mobile browser to play a game/ application.
* The 3D version of the app would be difficult to port to a mobile setting.

### Consequences

* Good, because our team will have more time to focus on the application core functionality.
* Bad, because fewer users are supported at the current time.


## More Information

* We are considering expanding the 2D version to mobile browser, but this would require effort in a later sprint.
