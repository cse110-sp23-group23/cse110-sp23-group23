# Creating of a side bar menu to carry out various functions and instructions

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed a place to hold more information about the app, without making it look cluttered. Volume controls, instructions for user controls, credits, and refreshing the page manually all needed to be addressed in a pretty fashion.

## Decision Drivers

* Users knowledge of how to dispense a fortune
* Users knowledge of how to mute the volume
* Desire to include credits for copyright and acknowledgement of other helpful people

### Consequences

* Good, because now users will be able to learn the instructions after first opening the website
* Good, because we will avoid copyright infrigment by giving proper credits to Zoltar
* Good, because it creates a hub for valuable information for the user
* Bad, because it makes the screen more cluttered with non 3D "pretty" modeling

## More Information

N/A.
