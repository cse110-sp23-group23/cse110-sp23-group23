# Fortune 500 (Team Contract)
## Team 23 â€” CSE 110 @ UC San Diego, Spring 2023

We agree to the rules set forth in this contract.

We expect team members to
1. be present mentally and physically when possible, and clearly articulate blockers when not,
2. build off of ideas instead of tearing them down,
3. understand and respect each others' preferences for communication, and clearly articulate their own,
4. meet at agreed upon times,
5. uphold standards of integrity and quality when developing code,
6. create an environment where people are comfortable reaching out for help,
7. reach out for help as soon as possible when it is needed,
8. and treat everyone and their tasks as equally important to the success of the team.

In the case that the above expectations are not fulfilled we will
1. reach out to understand root causes,
2. reassign members to tasks they feel more comfortable doing,
3. meet one-on-one with team leads to draw a path forward,
4. and reach out to course staff as a last resort.
