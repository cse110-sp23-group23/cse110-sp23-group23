## Issues Resolved

### Adding Audio Elements (AATASH)
#### What we did: Background audio elements added
#### How: Added background eerie sound, along with lightning sound effects on occasion.

### Zoltar machine screen image (AATASH)
#### What we did: Added image for Machine screen image
#### How: Found image of Zoltar machine, placed into 2D main html, referenced in 2D main js

### Ticket Display (NEEL)
#### What we did:
#### How:

### Ticket generation functionality (XIOANAN)
#### What we did:
#### How:

### Loading screen time expiration from 3D (PRASH)
#### What we did:
#### How:

## Looking Ahead: 
We would like to implement an image bank for the tickets, in which each ticket has its own unique image on the back. After discussing, it is also a possibility that we may implement user input and have a similar response functionality to our [Magic 8 Ball](https://cse110-sp23-group23.github.io/cse110-sp23-group23/source/8ball/). We will also make it our mission to add succinct comments similar to our 3d scripts.

## Looking Ahead: 
We are looking to implement flipping collected tickets, discarding individual tickets, and clearing all of the collected tickets. We also plan on implementing GPT AI and a user input system for a better UX involving sentiment analysis and basic LLM capabilities... We have not ironed out the details, the general control flow is:
- paper spit out of the machine, user inputs and puts it back in -> GPT -> Zoltar outputs
