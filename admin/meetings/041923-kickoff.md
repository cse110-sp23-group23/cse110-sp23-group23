### **Decisions Made (and Reasoning)**:
- Prashasth will work on team page a bit more
    - There isn't much left to do; one person can do this. Prashasth volunteered. Everyone should send or upload a small description of themselves.
- Everyone will contribute ideas on branding guidelines
    - We need to have this done ASAP, and having everyone contribute a little will be faster. One person can add them all to repo.
- We want poster done ASAP—everyone who can is meeting Thursday before class.
